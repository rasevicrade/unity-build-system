# Unity build system
## How to use
0. Materials in asset are HDRP
1. Get BuildSystem.unitypackage from release page
2. In your project select Assets > Import package > Custom package 
3. From the imported BuildSystem directory drag Blueprint prefab in scene
4. Select the prefab in Hierarchy, choose the prefab type and click Create preview button
5. You can press Tab to remove current prefab
6. While scene in focus, click Shift + 1 to move the floor prefab to first floor

That's it for now, still a work in progress.
